Info

I am developing the EZ-Homelab repository. The focus is on the repo not the test system.
I'm troubleshooting the ez-homelab.sh setup process. 

Install notes

Ran install script directly on fresh Debian 12 install without creating the .env file first. 
    There was a permission error creating .env file.
    Note in order to install docker it must be run with sudo, then logout/login and rerun script without sudo.
    When running with sudo it forces you to logout/login even if docker was already installed and running. If docker installed it should skip that part and continue.

SSHed in using VS Code, manually created the .env file.
    ran ez-homelab.sh completed without errors

Sablier lazyloading wasn't working, the services were available by ip:port

Required configure docker daemon on server to listen on port 2375 unsecured and  
sudo ufw allow 2375/tcp
    Need to implement TLS and configure sablier to use TLS

Resolution

- Fixed ez-homelab.sh to handle .env file creation as the actual user to avoid permission errors.
- Added check for Docker group membership to only prompt logout when necessary.
- Implemented TLS for Docker API (port 2376) with proper certificates.
- Configured Sablier to use TLS with mounted certificates and DOCKER_HOST=tcp://${SERVER_IP}:2376.
- Updated healthchecks in media-management services to use localhost instead of ${SERVER_IP}.
- Verified TLS connection working, Sablier detecting groups successfully.
